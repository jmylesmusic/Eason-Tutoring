    How soon can you meet?
We will work you into our schedule as quickly as we can. If our schedule does not match well with your availability, we will refer you to someone else.

My child hasn't done well learning online, how is online tutoring different?
Online classrooms are not easy for many students. Online tutoring is one-on-one which means we can go as slow or as fast as a student needs, students can ask as many questions as they want, and we can pay close attention to their behavior as they work. What might be accidentally missed when you're one of 20+ faces on screen is almost impossible to miss one-on-one.

Why do you charge more for in-person tutoring? Isn't the instruction the same?
Yes. All of our clients receive the same level of instruction, involvement, and dedication regardless of how the meeting happens. In person clients are paying for us to spend extra time coming to their house or workplace, bringing supplies, and then traveling back home. The extra $10 helps pay for that time we can't spend preparing for a session or helping another client because we are traveling.

Does an adult need to be there during a child's lesson?
We encourage you to have an adult nearby, especially if your child is learning online. This can make the child feel more comfortable and help us navigate any technical challenges. We do offer short meet and greets for our youngest clients prior to their first session.

How can you help me learn if you don't understand the subject?
It’s true, we can't tutor what we don't know. We can, however, help you try different strategies and practice good study skills for any subject: This is the difference between academic coaching and tutoring. If you don't have a lot of experience studying or teaching yourself, then we can help you learn how to do that, regardless of the topic.

*Please Note: We are never alone with a child. If another adult cannot be close by (in the next room), we will get your consent and record either the audio or visual of the lesson for your records.
